In this assignment it is required to use packages for autonomous navigation in order to make a robot navigate a house composed by 6 rooms. In each room it is located a ball with a specific color; each color is therefore associated to a different room as follow\+:


\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item Blue\+:Entrance
\item Red\+:Closet
\item Green\+:Living Room
\item Yellow\+:Kitchen
\item Magenta\+:Bathroom
\item Black\+:Bedroom
\end{DoxyItemize}

The robot should then implement four behaviors\+:


\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item Normal
\item Sleep
\item Play
\item Find
\end{DoxyItemize}\hypertarget{md__r_e_a_d_m_e_autotoc_md2}{}\doxysection{Architecture and parameters}\label{md__r_e_a_d_m_e_autotoc_md2}
In order to build the map of the house and make the robot navigate around it properly(avoiding abstacles) I used the Gmapping filtering-\/based approach and the Move\+Base package which is part of the ROS Navigation stack. The Move\+Base package has the final purpose to make a robot navigate an environment using both a local and global path planner that can be selected by the user. The Mobe\+Base relies on a map that can be known a-\/priori or can be built during the execution(our case). Since the Move\+Base implements an action server, inside the folder src of the exp-\/\+Assignment3 package I implemented the action client \textquotesingle{}simple\+\_\+navigation\+\_\+goals\textquotesingle{}, responsible for sending goals to the action server and therefore move the robot to the correct position. The goals generated by the action client are expressed with respect to the frame of the map, and not the frame of the robot. The explore-\/lite package is used together with Move\+Base and Gmapping to automatically explore the map when required. In order to enable and disable the functioning of the package during the code execution, I used 
\begin{DoxyCode}{0}
\DoxyCodeLine{\$ self.child = subprocess.Popen(["{}roslaunch"{},"{}explore\_lite"{},"{}explore.launch"{}])}
\DoxyCodeLine{\$ self.child.send\_signal(signal.SIGINT)}

\end{DoxyCode}
 This was necessary because the motion of the robot had to rely on that package only during the Find state.

Inside the folder script of the same package I implemented the state machine \textquotesingle{}\mbox{\hyperlink{state__machine_8py}{state\+\_\+machine.\+py}}\textquotesingle{}, that leads the whole process. This node communicates with the action client publishing target positions expressed as a list of integers(as shown inside the msg folder). ~\newline


The state machine makes use of some data\+: inside the workspace the file \textquotesingle{}param.\+yaml\textquotesingle{} can be found, which contains default data that will be stored in the parameter server once the program is executed.

In the first 6 lines we can find parameters to associate each room with a color. If we consider the first line\+:

Closet\+: \mbox{[}-\/5.\+41, 2.\+48, \textquotesingle{}F\textquotesingle{}, red\+\_\+ball\mbox{]}

I described each room with a list of arguments, the first two indicates the (x,y) reference coordinates of the room(extracted using Rviz), the third indicates if the room has already been discovered by the robot, while the last simply associate the room to a ball as required.

With the following line I simly created a list with the rooms of the apartment

rooms\+: \mbox{[}\textquotesingle{}red\+\_\+ball\textquotesingle{}, \textquotesingle{}green\+\_\+ball\textquotesingle{}, \textquotesingle{}blue\+\_\+ball\textquotesingle{}, \textquotesingle{}black\+\_\+ball\textquotesingle{}, \textquotesingle{}magenta\+\_\+ball\textquotesingle{}, \textquotesingle{}yellow\+\_\+ball\textquotesingle{}\mbox{]}

In the end, I stored some default position

play\+Pose\+: \mbox{[}-\/5, 8\mbox{]} home\+Pose\+: \mbox{[}-\/2.\+86, -\/2.\+95\mbox{]}

Inside the state machine are implemented the four abovementioned states\+:


\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item Normal State\+: relying on the Move\+Base packages, the robot moves randomly around the house; in particular, a new target is sent everytime the robot stops moving. While moving the robot may detect a new colored object in the house. When this happens, the robot switches to the function Track. In this function the robot, after getting closer to the detected object, updates the parameter server marking as discovered the corresponding room(the third parameter in the list of the room is set to \textquotesingle{}T\textquotesingle{}). After some time, the robot switches to the play or sleep state.
\item Sleep State\+: the robot goes to a predifined location(taken from the parameter server) and stays there for a certain time. After that goes back to Normal behaviour.
\item Play State\+: the robot goes to the play pose(taken from the parameter server) waiting for a go\+To command. The go\+To command is simulated extracting randomly from the parameter \textquotesingle{}rooms\textquotesingle{} in the parameter server. The robot checks if the extracted room has already been discovered. If so, goes there using the (x,y) coordinates stored in the parameter server. After this it goes back to the play pose waiting for another go\+To command. On the contraty, if the room has not been discovered yet, it switches to the Find state passing as parameter the color of the ball in that room.
\item Find state\+: the robot starts moving around the house relying on the explore-\/lite package. When it detects a new ball it switches to the Track function that works as in the normal state. Then the robot checks if the ball in the just detected room coincide with the ball received by the Play state. If so, it goes back to the play behaviour; if not, keeps moving around the house. After some time, if the robot has not detected the received room, goes back to the play behaviour.
\end{DoxyItemize}

In each state I used lots of \textquotesingle{}loginfo\textquotesingle{} functions in order to be able to follow the state machine behaviour and check that everyting is working properly.

Inside the workspace we can find the following packages\+:
\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item \mbox{\hyperlink{namespaceexp__assignment3}{exp\+\_\+assignment3}}\+: contains the state machine inside the folder script, the simple\+\_\+navigation\+\_\+goals action client inside the folder src, the launch file simulation.\+launch inside the folder launch(which is used to launch the whole simulation, opening both Gazebo and Rviz).
\item planning\+: contains the gmapping.\+launch and the the move\+\_\+base.\+launch files inside the launch folder.
\item gmapping\+: contains the description of the robot inside the urdf folder and the code used by the gmapping algorithm.
\item explore\+: contains the explore.\+launch file that activates the explore-\/lite package. Inside the doxygen folder we can find the code documentation of the project.

Looking at the terminal we can follow all the steps performed by the state machine including its change of states.\hypertarget{md__r_e_a_d_m_e_autotoc_md5}{}\doxysection{System features and possible tecnical improvements}\label{md__r_e_a_d_m_e_autotoc_md5}
To test and correct the robot behaviour I added print functions in the code. This is also useful in order to follow the robot behavior during the program execution. During the whole execution I decided to publish new target positions to the move\+Base action client everytime the robot stops moving. This is the easiest solution I found to be sure that the state machine is \textquotesingle{}syncronized\textquotesingle{} with the motion of the robot. While the robot is moving to some position guided by the move\+Base package it may happen that it detects a colored ball in the environment\+: the robot will now start moving towards the ball simply publishing new commands on the cmd\+\_\+vel topic. The robot will stop tracking the ball when the velocity published on cmd\+\_\+vel is almost 0 or a predefined number of iteration has been reached(this last option was needed because sometimes it happens that the robot is not able to actually reach the ball because it gets stuck in some wall). Once the robot stops tracking the ball, it will continue following its previous goal relying again on the commands published by move\+Base.

Some possible improvements\+:
\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item Handle the fact that sometimes the robot is required to move to a position which is outside the walls of the house.
\item In order to execute the transition between normal and play state I simply introduced a counter in the normal state. Once the counter reaches a predefined value the system switches to the play state. One improvement might be to receive the play command from a stand alone node.
\item As said before, the reference positions of each room, have been stored manually before the execution inside the parameter server. However, the positions will be unknown to the robot until it actually explore the rooms; only in that moment the reference positions will be marked as \textquotesingle{}T\textquotesingle{} and therefore the robot will be able to use them. One improvement might be to obtain the positions at runtime once the robot gets close to the ball.
\end{DoxyItemize}

Regarding the last point, I decided to store myself the reference positions of the rooms because, as said before, I noticed that in some rare case when the robot detects a new ball it is not always able to actually gets close to it since it may get stuck in some walls between its position and the ball. This of course may happen since in the ball tracking the robot is not relying on the move\+Base package to guide its motion.\hypertarget{md__r_e_a_d_m_e_autotoc_md6}{}\doxysection{Author and contacts}\label{md__r_e_a_d_m_e_autotoc_md6}
